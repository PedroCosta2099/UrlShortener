# URL Shortening API Landing Page

## The challenge

Integrate with the [shrtcode API](https://shrtco.de/) to create shortened URLs and display them

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Shorten any valid URL
- See a list of their shortened links, even after refreshing the browser
- Copy the shortened link to their clipboard in a single click
- Receive an error message when the form is submitted if:
    - The input field is empty

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.


## My Process

To begin with, i structured the entire application with HTML and CSS. 

Then i made the function that makes the API request and passed the API values ​​to the application.

In the end, I made the application responsive.

## Build with

* HTML
* SCSS
* Javascript
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* React JSX
* Axios

## What I learned

* Use SCSS
* Use React JSX
* Improve the use of useEffect and useState
